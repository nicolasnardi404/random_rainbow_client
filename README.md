Random Rainbow is a cyber art project designed to connect queer video art through a random experience. Any queer artist can join, create an account, and upload up to three video links to our platform.

On the homepage, you'll find a "Random" button. Each time it's pressed, a video is randomly selected from our database and displayed on your screen.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us at info@randomrainbow.art.

This an independent website and it is built entirely from scratch, with Java powering the backend and JavaScript with React for the frontend.
