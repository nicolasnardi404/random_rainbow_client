            Random Rainbow is a cyber art project born to connect queer video
            artists through a random experience. Built from scratch and driven
            by a desire for fluid, boundless connection, it celebrates chance
            encounters and endless possibilities. Here, connections are never
            fixed—each click unveils something new, with no set order or
            repetition. Every visit is a fresh experience.
          </h1>
          <h1>
            Random Rainbow believes in randomness as a radical, non-hierarchical
            way to explore. There is no map, no structure to follow—just an open
            flow of queer creative expression. A playground beyond the ordinary.
